# Hello Contributor o/!
#
# We greatly care about the our git history and maintainability.  This is why we
# have a very strict commit message policy in place.  This policy is governed and
# we ask for your cooperation in keeping our git messages clean
#
# Please use the following guidelines for all commit messages:
#
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
########50 characters############################
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body>
########72 characters##################################################
# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>
#
# The HEADER is a single line 50 characters max that contains a succinct description
# of that change.  It also contains a type, an optional scope and a subject
#
#   + <type>      describes the kind of change that this commit is. Allowed types are:
#       * build     (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies) 🛠
#       * ci        (changes to the ci configuration files and scripts) ⚙️
#       * feat      (feature) ✨
#       * fix        (bug fix) 🐛
#       * perf      (improves performance) 🚀
#       * docs      (documentation) 📚
#       * style     (formatting, missing semicolons, linting ...) 💎
#       * refactor  (code change, neither fixes a bug or adds a feature) 📦
#       * revert    (undo, revert to a previous version of the code) 🗑
#       * test      (add missing tests) 🚨
#       * chore     (maintenance) ♻️
#   + <scope>     can be anything that specifies the context of the commit. i.e. a service name
#   + <subject>   very short description of the change in the following format:
#       * imperative, present tense: "change" NOT "changes"/"changed"
#       * no capitalized first letters
#       * not dot (.) at the end
#
# The BODY should include the motivation for the change "the why" and contrast this with previous
# behavior and must be phrased in imperative present tense and 72 characters max per line
#
# The FOOTER should contain any information about "Breaking Changes" and references to list any
# "Ticket Numbers" that this commit closes
#
# "Breaking Changes" should start with the words BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two new lines.
# The rest of the commit message is used for this purpose.
#
# Thank you <3
